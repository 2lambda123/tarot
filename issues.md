#Issues

These are the tasks I am setting out for myself on this project. This list will grow exponentially but it will also keep me on task & help keep this project moving forward. 

- [ ] Format the deck object & begin filling with "readings".
- [ ] Utilize AJAX to load "readings" after cards have been dealt.
- [ ] Implement a "readings" output on the page depending on which card is dealt.
- [ ] Redact the code to deal the random card from the object (as opposed to the original array) in order to stay DRY.
- [ ] Create multiple interpretations so that the readings have more variety.
- [ ] Wireframe a front end layout.
- [ ] Build out the app page.
- [ ] Build around the app a site design.
- [ ] Make sure all the design is responsive.
- [ ] Change deck image, illustration of Pamela Colman Smith dealing cards?
